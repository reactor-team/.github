### The Developer Platform for World Models

*Making it possible for anyone to create real-time, interactive media applications*

</div>

---

## Our Mission

We believe real-time media generation and world models will unlock the next frontier of creativity and human experience. Every pixel will be generated.

This technology will enable infinite experience creation: educational apps that adapt to each learner, training simulations indistinguishable from reality, games that evolve with player choices, and ultimately entire applications where nothing is pre-rendered. From entertainment to education, simulation to creation, generated worlds will transform how we learn, play, work, and connect.

Reactor is the developer platform making this possible. We provide a unified system for building real-time applications powered by World Models, with sub-100ms latency and custom GPU orchestration.

## The Platform

**SDKs & APIs**
The full developer experience for building any World Model application. Intuitive tools that handle complexity so developers can easily build.

**Optimized Models**
Curated, production-ready World Models (Open + Closed) optimized for real-time performance.

**Global Cloud Infrastructure**
Sub-100ms latency with custom GPU orchestration. Enterprise-grade reliability and scale.

**Model Optimization**
Advanced optimization techniques to maximize performance and minimize latency for production deployments.
